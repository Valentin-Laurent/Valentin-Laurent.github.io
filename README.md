POC of a collaborative 2048 (original game available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.play2048&hl=en_US&gl=US)), using Streamlit and Pandas for the graphical rendering, and pure Python for the game engine.

The result is available [here](https://share.streamlit.io/valentin-laurent/Collaborative-2048/app.py) on Streamlit Cloud. A GitHub workflow pings the app once a week to keep it up and running.

This package also contains the required config files to deploy the game on Heroku.
